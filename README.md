## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you don't have Rust installed, you can install it by following these steps:

1. Download and install `rustup` by following the instructions at [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/).

2. Once `rustup` is installed, open a new terminal and run the following command to install the Rust compiler:

```bash
rustup install stable
```

3. Add the cargo binary to your PATH with the following command:

```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## Installing

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arvid-berndtsson/Rust-Sorting-Algorithms.git
```

2. Navigate into the cloned repository

```bash
cd rust-sorting-algorithms
```

3. Build the project

```bash
cargo build
```

## Running

You can run the project with:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Testing

You can run the tests with:

```bash
